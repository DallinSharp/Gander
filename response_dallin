My name is Dallin Sharp and I'd be interested in working on this project. Although I don't have much experience with databases outside of BYU coursework, I recently finished CS 260, and as such have fresh knowledge of using web tools such as Vue, NodeJS and Mongo to create an application. I believe I would make a godo addition to this team, and I look forward to working with you.
