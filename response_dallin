My name is Dallin Sharp and I'd be interested in working on this project. 

# Business
I like the proposed model, as it is pretty tried and true in every aspect of technology.
# Legal
Although it would probably be ambitious for an initial release, creating some sort of reporting/moderating functionalities would help to ensure that encouraged activities are safe, just to make sure nobody hurts themselves copying overtly dangerous posts on Gander.
# Technical
Although I don't have much experience with databases outside of BYU coursework, I recently finished CS 260, and as such have fresh knowledge of using web tools such as Vue, NodeJS and Mongo to create an application. I believe I would make a godo addition to this team, and I look forward to working with you.
